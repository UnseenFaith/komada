Komada is a modular framework for bots built on top of [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/dicord.js). It offers an extremely easy installation, downloadable commands, and a framework to build your own commands, modules, and functions.

## What's with the name?

Komada is the Croatian word for "pieces", such as puzzle pieces. As usual to find my software name I just shove english words in a translator and see what comes out. But why "pieces"? Because Komada is modular, meaning each "piece" is a standalone part that can be easily replaced, enhanced, reloaded, removed.

## Installing Komada

Time to take the plunge! Komada is on NPM and can be easily installed.

> I assume you know how to open a command prompt in a folder where you want to install this. Please don't prove me wrong.

```
npm install --save komada
```

Create a file called `app.js` (or whatever you prefer) which will initiate and configure Komada.

```js
const komada = require('komada');
komada.start({
  "botToken": "your-bot-token",
  "ownerID" : "your-user-id",
  "clientID": "the-invite-app-id",
  "prefix": "+",
  "clientOptions": {
    "fetchAllMembers": true
  }
});
```

### Configuration Options

- **botToken**: The MFA token for your bot. To get this, please see [This discord.js Getting Started Guide](https://eslachance.gitbooks.io/discord-js-bot-guide/content/getting-started/the-long-version.html), which explains how to create the bot and get the token.
- **ownerID**: The User ID of the bot owner - you. This gives you the highest possible access to the bot's default commands, including eval! To obtain it, enable Developer Mode in Discord, right-click your name and do "Copy ID".
- **clientID**: The bot's client ID obtained from the same place you got the token. It's at the top of the page!
- **prefix**: The default prefix when the bot first boots up. This option becomes useless after first boot, since the prefix is written to the default configuration system.
- **clientOptions**: These are passed directly to the discord.js library. They are optional. For more information on which options are available, see [ClientOptions in the discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/ClientOptions).

> For all you selfbot users out there, you can add a option ('selfbot': true) to have Komada enabled for selfbot usage. i.e. only respond to commands from you.

## Running the bot

Then, run the following in your folder:

```
npm install
node --harmony app.js
```

> **Requirements**: Requires Node 7 or higher to run. Depends on Discord.js v11 or higher (the appropriate version is automatically installed).
