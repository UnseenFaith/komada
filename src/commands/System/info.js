    "• Per-server settings for each guild, that can be extended with your own code",
    "• Customizable Command system with automated usage parsing and easy to use reloading and downloading modules",
    "• \"Monitors\" which can watch messages and act on them, like a normal message event (Swear Filters, Spam Protection, etc)",
    "• \"Inhibitors\" which can prevent commands from running based on a set of parameters (Permissions, Blacklists, etc)",
    "• \"Providers\" which allow you to connect with an outside database of your choosing. Not yet documented.",
    "• \"Finalizers\" which run on messages after a successful command.",

    "• Internal \"Functions\" which allow you to use functions anywhere where you have access to a client variable.",
