be accessed via `require("komada").PermLevels`, and is used via `permlevels.addLevel(level, break, checkFunction)`. Once

- [[#197](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada/pull/197)] Command Editing is now possible via setting `config.cmdEditing`

- [[#197](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada/pull/197)] With the new command cache, you also have access to
`commandMessage sweeping`. These are 2 new Komada configs as integers in seconds: `config.commandMessageLifetime` and
`config.commandMessageSweep`.

- [[#197](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada/pull/197)] Finalizers: Functions which are run on after a successful
command. Please Note: All command files must return an Object Promise. You can achieve that by adding the `async`
keyword. `exports.run = __async__ (client, msg, [...args])`.
- [[#197](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada/pull/197)] Command Cooldowns are now available through a new
**inhibitor/finalizer** combo. Simply set `command.conf.cooldown` to an integer in seconds to put a cooldown on that
command.
